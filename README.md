Duuude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Henry Danger: The Movie and, yo, all sorts of wild stuff happened. Seriously, they really went all out on this one. I mean, so many explosions and stunts like, what even, did they just throw the budget out on pyrotechnics or something? 😂 And okay, I get that it's supposed to be quirky and all, but some parts were just straight-up bizarre. Like, did they really have to deal with those giant lobsters, or was it just some writer’s fever dream or something? I was kinda into it though, not gonna lie.

> Honestly, the whole thing with Captain Man being, like, super dramatic half the time 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed me up. He's legit trying to steal the spotlight in every single scene, and I'm just here thinking, chill, dude, let the kids have some time to shine, ya know? Ahh, being a superhero do be exhausting I guess. 😂

And that villain, who was that guy even? Like, at one point I legit thought they were just gonna drop him entirely. There was a point I paused to go get some snacks, and honestly considered whether to just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and save it for later. But then the FOMO was real, had to see how this all goes down, you feel me?

Sometimes I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a   like that and wonder, do they even know what universe they're building here, or is it just a wing it and hope it works sorta thing? I mean, anyway, I don't exactly go into these superhero kid flicks expecting cinematic masterpieces, so maybe I'm just overthinking it. Still, was a fun ride.

Oh, and Jasper is a total mood in this one. Seriously, such a goofball, but hey, we all need a Jasper in our lives sometimes, even if just for comedic relief, am I right? 😂

print(Uhhh, why did I even type this?)

Anyway, now I'm just sitting here, exhausted and amused, and maybe a little confused. Gotta love it when a   leaves you like that, sorta meh but also, hey, it was something! Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Maybe not immediately, but who knows. Ah, the life of a superhero   binge-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩er... you know what I mean?
